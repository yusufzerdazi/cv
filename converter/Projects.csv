Hitbox,"Hitbox is a symmetric, multiplayer, browser-based brawler game. The aim of the game, as usual, is to kill each other. Damage is dealt when players collide, the quicker player hurting the slower player. Quicker collisions deal more damage. Players can boost to quickly increase their speed, but must wait for their stamina to recover before boosting again. Crouching makes players invulnerable to horizontal damage, but they can't move and can still be hit from above.",,,
Text Trek,"Text Trek is a community-based, AI driven text based adventure game. Imagine huge persistent worlds spanning centuries, characters finding artifacts from past generations, and thrilling open-ended plotlines with atmospheric artwork. It's not there yet, but it's still pretty cool.",,,
